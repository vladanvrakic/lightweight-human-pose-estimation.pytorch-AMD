# AMD ROCm/MIGraphX Acceleration for Lightweight Human Pose Estimation

This repository is an AMD ROCm/MIGraphX optimization fork of the Lightweight OpenPose-style human pose estimation pipeline.

Starting from a ROCKm vrsion seven dot two and PyTorch implementation of Lightweight OpenPose, we progressively removed performance bottlenecks beyond neural network inference.
Pipeline was accelerated using a combination of MIGraphX inference backend, fp16 casting, restructuring model graph, and custom HIP GPU kernels.
The final architecture processes eight simultaneous camera streams in real time, delivering more than 70 FPS across the system while keeping end-to-end latency below 100 milliseconds, making it well suited for live monitoring and multi-camera deployments.

The result is a scalable AMD-accelerated computer vision solution capable of accurate, low-latency multi-person pose estimation across multiple concurrent video streams.

## Fork Lineage and Scope

This project has three layers of context:

| Layer | Role in this repository |
|---|---|
| Original Lightweight Human Pose Estimation / Lightweight OpenPose | Provides the MobileNet-based 2D multi-person pose model, heatmap and PAF output structure, and the original CPU postprocessing idea. |
| `cane122/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch-AMD` | Provides the AMD-oriented fork baseline, including the direction of running the pose model with ROCm/MIGraphX on AMD hardware. |
| `ognjen217/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch-AMD` | Adds postprocessing optimization, MIGraphX postprocess heads, split MXR/HIP execution paths, custom HIP kernels, validation tooling, profiling, and multi-camera stream simulation. |

The neural network concept remains the same: the model predicts body-keypoint heatmaps and part-affinity fields (PAFs), and the final human poses are assembled from those outputs. The main divergence is not a new pose model architecture, but a progressively optimized runtime around that model.

## Detailed Summary of Changes Since the Fork

The starting point for this work was an AMD/MIGraphX-enabled version of the lightweight pose model. Once the model could run through MIGraphX, inference itself was no longer the only interesting performance problem. Profiling showed that the classical postprocessing path still performed a large amount of CPU work: full-resolution heatmap resizing, keypoint extraction, non-maximum suppression, PAF sampling, limb scoring, pose assembly, and repeated CPU/GPU data movement. In other words, accelerating the neural network exposed the rest of the pipeline.

The first set of changes consolidated and optimized the CPU-side postprocessing baseline. The original postprocess flow was kept as `standard`, while faster variants such as `optimized_batch_k20_fast` introduced batched keypoint extraction and a faster grouping implementation. These variants were important because they created an accuracy-preserving CPU reference that was significantly faster than the original implementation. They also gave every later GPU/MIGraphX/HIP experiment a fair baseline to compare against.

The next step moved selected postprocessing stages toward GPU execution. The `gpu_nms_fullres_two_process` path runs MIGraphX inference and Torch GPU NMS in separate processes. That separation is deliberate: on some ROCm setups, initializing MIGraphX and PyTorch GPU execution in the same process is fragile or inefficient. The two-process design made it possible to test GPU heatmap NMS while keeping the model inference process stable. This phase showed that GPU postprocessing can help, but it also made clear that simply moving one operation to the GPU is not enough when later PAF scoring and pose assembly still dominate.

After that, the repository introduced MIGraphX postprocess heads. Instead of treating postprocessing as only Python/NumPy/OpenCV code, generated ONNX graphs were compiled into `.mxr` artifacts for fixed input shapes. The fused and fused-pruned paths moved manual cubic heatmap resizing, NMS, TopK extraction, PAF pair scoring, and pair pruning into compiled MIGraphX graphs. The `merged_fused_pruned` / `pose_postprocessing_merged` direction went further by merging the pose model and the fused-pruned postprocess head into one MXR graph. This was useful for high-resolution fixed-shape streams, but the dense full-resolution heatmap branch still created large intermediate tensors at 1080p.

The split pipeline was introduced to break that large fused graph into better optimization boundaries. In the `MXR1 + HIP1 + MXR2` design, MXR1 is a split pose-adapter model that produces only heatmaps and PAFs. HIP1 is a custom HIP smart heatmap candidate extraction stage that performs low-resolution proposal selection and local full-resolution refinement, returning compact `top_scores` and `top_indices`. MXR2 then consumes PAFs and the HIP1 TopK outputs to score and prune candidate limb pairs. This design made the stream simulator runnable with a clearer separation between model inference, heatmap candidate generation, and PAF pruning.

Profiling of the `MXR1 + HIP1 + MXR2` stream showed that MXR2 had become the next bottleneck. Full-resolution PAF sampling inside the MXR2 graph lowered into a large number of small MIGraphX gather kernels, so the final successful optimization replaced MXR2 with HIP2: a custom HIP backend for PAF pair scoring and pruning. The current recommended path is therefore `MXR1 + custom HIP heatmapping + custom HIP PAF-pruning`, or `split_hip2_host_smart` in the simulator. This path keeps the output contract of the split pipeline, but removes the gather-heavy MXR2 stage and improves the 10-camera stream from the previous MXR2-based best of 50.44 aggregate FPS and 194.60 ms average E2E latency to 75.92 aggregate FPS and 88.46 ms average E2E latency.

## Runtime Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `standard` | Reference postprocess path: full-resolution resize, original per-channel keypoint extraction, original grouping. Useful as correctness baseline, but slow. |
| `optimized_batch_k20_fast` | CPU-optimized full-resolution path with batched K=20 candidate extraction and faster grouping. Good CPU fallback/reference. |
| `gpu_nms_fullres_two_process` | Hybrid path with MIGraphX inference in one process and Torch GPU NMS in another process. Useful when PyTorch ROCm and MIGraphX should not share one process. |
| `merged_fused_pruned` / `pose_postprocessing_merged` | Merged pose + fused-pruned postprocess MXR path. Useful for fixed-shape high-resolution graph experiments. |
| `MXR1` | Split pose-adapter MIGraphX model. It takes the image tensor and returns compact heatmaps and PAFs. |
| `HIP1` | Custom HIP heatmap candidate extraction. It performs smart low-resolution proposal selection and local full-resolution refinement, returning `top_scores` and `top_indices`. |
| `MXR2` | Previous split PAF-pruning MIGraphX graph. It consumes PAFs and TopK heatmap candidates, then outputs pruned limb-pair tensors. It was later replaced because it became gather-kernel dominated. |
| `HIP2` | Custom HIP PAF pair scoring and pruning backend. It replaces MXR2 while preserving the same pruned-pair output contract. |
| CPU assembly tail | Final dynamic pose assembly step that consumes TopK keypoints and pruned limb-pair tensors. This is still on CPU. |

## Setup

Create and activate a Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

Check that MIGraphX is importable:

```bash
python -c "import migraphx; print('MIGraphX OK')"
```

If MIGraphX is installed under `/opt/rocm` but Python cannot import it, add the ROCm library path to the active environment:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import site
from pathlib import Path

site_dir = Path(site.getsitepackages()[0])
(site_dir / "rocm-migraphx.pth").write_text("/opt/rocm/lib\n")
print(site_dir / "rocm-migraphx.pth")
PY
```

Common geometry used by the current experiments:

```text
Model input:          [B, 3, 544, 968]
Low-resolution maps:  heatmaps [B, 18 or 19, 68, 121], PAFs [B, 38, 68, 121]
Stream resolution:    commonly 1920x1080 or 1280x720 CCTV-like videos
Stride:               8
```

Typical local artifacts expected by the example commands:

```text

## Generating and Compiling Models

The repository contains several model-generation paths. The important distinction is:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Pose ONNX | Exported from the PyTorch `.pth` checkpoint. |
| Pose MXR | Static-batch MIGraphX model for pose inference only. |
| Fused-pruned postprocess ONNX/MXR | Compiled postprocess head for fixed heatmap/PAF and output resolution shapes. |
| Merged pose+postprocess MXR | Single MXR graph containing pose inference plus fused-pruned postprocess outputs. |
| MXR1 split pose adapter | Current final stream model. Produces heatmaps and PAFs for HIP1/HIP2. |
| MXR2 split PAF-pruning graph | Previous split-path PAF pruning backend. Replaced by HIP2 in the final stream path, but still useful for comparison. |
| HIP1/HIP2 shared libraries | Native HIP postprocess backends loaded by Python wrappers. |

### 1. Export the PyTorch checkpoint to ONNX

`tools/export_dynamic_onnx.py` exports the PyTorch checkpoint into a dynamic-batch ONNX model. The script currently uses constants near the top of the file, so edit them if your checkpoint or output path differs.

```bash
python tools/export_dynamic_onnx.py
```

Default paths used by the script:

```text
Input checkpoint: models/checkpoint_iter_370000.pth
Output ONNX:      pose_model_dynamic.onnx
Input geometry:   [1, 3, 544, 968]
```

### 2. Compile static-batch pose MXR models

For normal pose-model MXRs, compile the exported pose ONNX with static batch sizes:

```bash
python tools/compile_migraphx_static_batches.py \
  --onnx pose_model_dynamic.onnx \
  --height 544 \
  --width 968 \
  --batches 1 2 4 \
  --out-dir models \
  --output-prefix pose_model
```

This produces files like:

```text
models/pose_model_b1_fp16.mxr
models/pose_model_b2_fp16.mxr
models/pose_model_b4_fp16.mxr
```

Use `--no-fp16` to compile without FP16 quantization, or `--exhaustive-tune` when you want MIGraphX exhaustive tuning and can afford the compile time.

### 3. Export a fused-pruned postprocess head

This creates an ONNX graph that consumes heatmaps and PAFs and returns compact TopK keypoint and pruned limb-pair tensors.

For the smart-full-res path used in high-resolution merged experiments:

```bash
mkdir -p models/fused_postprocess_pruned_batchaware

python tools/export_batchaware_fused_pruned_postprocess.py \
  --onnx models/fused_postprocess_pruned_batchaware/fused_pruned_b4_1080x1920_smart.onnx \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --in-h 68 \
  --in-w 121 \
  --full-h 1080 \
  --full-w 1920 \
  --topk 20 \
  --limb-topm 20 \
  --threshold 0.1 \
  --nms-radius 6 \
  --nms-impl separable \
  --heatmap-mode smart-full-res \
  --smart-proposals 64 \
  --smart-local-radius 8 \
  --smart-lowres-nms-radius 1
```

Compile an arbitrary generated ONNX to MXR with:

```bash
python tools/compile_onnx_to_migraphx.py \
  --onnx models/fused_postprocess_pruned_batchaware/fused_pruned_b4_1080x1920_smart.onnx \
  --out models/fused_postprocess_pruned_batchaware/fused_pruned_b4_1080x1920_smart.mxr
```

### 4. Build a merged pose + fused-pruned MXR

The merged path combines the pose model ONNX and the fused-pruned postprocess ONNX into one compiled MXR graph.

```bash
python tools/compile_merged_pose_batchaware_fused_pruned.py \
  --pose-onnx models/fp16_refinment1.onnx \
  --post-onnx models/fused_postprocess_pruned_batchaware/fused_pruned_b4_1080x1920_smart.onnx \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --output-onnx models/merged_pose_fused_pruned_b4_1080x1920_smart.onnx \
  --output-mxr models/merged_pose_fused_pruned_b4_1080x1920_smart.mxr
```

This path is useful for `pose_postprocessing_merged` / `merged_pose_fused_pruned` speed experiments. It is not the final recommended stream architecture because later split HIP2 experiments produced better latency.

### 5. Build MXR1 for the current split HIP pipeline

MXR1 is the split pose-adapter model used by the final `MXR1 + custom HIP heatmapping + custom HIP PAF-pruning` stream path.

```bash
python tools/export_split_pose_adapter.py \
  --pose-onnx models/fp16_refinment1.onnx \
  --batch-size 2 \
  --output-onnx models/split_pose_adapter/pose_adapter_b2_1080x1920.onnx \
  --output-mxr models/split_pose_adapter/pose_adapter_b2_1080x1920.mxr \
  --compile
```

MXR1 output contract:

```text
heatmaps [B, 18, 68, 121] fp32
pafs     [B, 38, 68, 121] fp32
```

### 6. Build MXR2 for the previous split pipeline

MXR2 is the older PAF-pruning graph used by `MXR1 + HIP1 + MXR2`. It is no longer the recommended final backend, but it is useful for comparison and for reproducing the previous split-pipeline stage.

```bash
python tools/export_split_paf_pruning_from_topk.py \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --in-h 68 \
  --in-w 121 \
  --full-h 1080 \
  --full-w 1920 \
  --topk 20 \
  --limb-topm 20 \
  --points-per-limb 8 \
  --min-paf-score 0.05 \
  --success-ratio-thr 0.8 \
  --paf-cubic-a -0.75 \
  --min-pair-score 0.0 \
  --compile
```

MXR2 input/output contract:

```text
inputs:
  pafs        [B, 38, 68, 121]
  top_scores  [B, 18, K]
  top_indices [B, 18, K]

outputs:
  limb_top_pair_a_idx [B, 19, M]
  limb_top_pair_b_idx [B, 19, M]
  limb_top_pair_score [B, 19, M]
  limb_top_pair_valid [B, 19, M]
```

### 7. Build HIP1 and HIP2 shared libraries

HIP1 heatmap backend:

```bash
./tools/build_heatmap_topk_hip.sh
```

HIP2 PAF-pruning backend:

```bash
./tools/build_paf_prune_hip.sh
```

By default, both scripts compile for `native`. On systems where an explicit architecture is needed, set the corresponding environment variable:

```bash
HIP_TOPK_OFFLOAD_ARCH=gfx1100 ./tools/build_heatmap_topk_hip.sh
HIP_PAF_PRUNE_OFFLOAD_ARCH=gfx1100 ./tools/build_paf_prune_hip.sh
```

Expected outputs:

```text
build/heatmap_topk_hip/libheatmap_topk_hip.so
build/paf_prune_hip/libpaf_prune_hip.so
```

## Running the Root Scripts

### 1. `speed_validation.py`

Use this script for video-based latency/FPS comparisons across postprocess variants.

Basic comparison:

```bash
python speed_validation.py \
  --video cctv_1280x720_24fps_3.mp4 \
  --model pose_model1_fp16_ref1.mxr \
  --frames 100 \
  --warmup 5 \
  --variants standard optimized_batch_k20_fast gpu_nms_fullres_two_process \
  --csv outputs/speed_validation_summary.csv \
  --json outputs/speed_validation_summary.json
```

MIGraphX NMS variants require either a precompiled NMS head/cache or automatic compilation:

```bash
python speed_validation.py \
  --video cctv_1280x720_24fps_3.mp4 \
  --model pose_model1_fp16_ref1.mxr \
  --frames 100 \
  --warmup 5 \
  --variants migraphx_nms migraphx_nms_k20 \
  --compile-migraphx-nms \
  --migraphx-nms-cache-dir models/nms_fullres_cache \
  --csv outputs/speed_validation_migraphx_nms.csv \
  --json outputs/speed_validation_migraphx_nms.json
```

Merged pose + fused-pruned MXR speed validation:

```bash
python speed_validation.py \
  --video cctv_1280x720_24fps_3.mp4 \
  --model pose_model1_fp16_ref1.mxr \
  --pose-postprocessing-merged-model models/merged_pose_fused_pruned_b4_1080x1920_smart.mxr \
  --frames 100 \
  --warmup 5 \
  --variants pose_postprocessing_merged \
  --csv outputs/speed_validation_merged.csv \
  --json outputs/speed_validation_merged.json
```

### 2. `accuracy_validation.py`

Use this script for COCO AP/AR validation and latency summaries. The root wrapper is intended for MIGraphX-safe validation routes; do not use the two-process GPU variants here.

CPU/reference and fused-pruned validation example:

```bash
python accuracy_validation.py \
  --models pose_model1_fp16_ref1.mxr \
  --labels coco/annotations/person_keypoints_val2017.json \
  --images-folder coco/val2017 \
  --output-dir outputs/accuracy_validation \
  --image-selection dominant-dimensions \
  --max-images 1000 \
  --variants standard optimized_batch_k20_fast merged_fused_pruned \
  --compile-missing-postprocess-heads \
  --max-keypoints 20 \
  --threshold 0.1
```

Previous split MXR2 validation path:

```bash
python accuracy_validation.py \
  --models models/split_pose_adapter/pose_adapter_b2_1080x1920.mxr \
  --labels coco/annotations/person_keypoints_val2017.json \
  --images-folder coco/val2017 \
  --output-dir outputs/accuracy_validation_split_mxr2 \
  --image-selection dominant-dimensions \
  --max-images 1000 \
  --validation-batch-size 2 \
  --variants split_hip_host_smart \
  --split-mxr2-auto-compile \
  --split-mxr2-batch-size 2 \
  --smart-proposals 32 \
  --smart-local-radius 4 \
  --smart-lowres-nms-radius 1 \
  --max-keypoints 20 \
  --threshold 0.1
```

Note: the final HIP2 stream path, `split_hip2_host_smart`, is a stream-simulator path. The accuracy wrapper shown above validates the previous split MXR2 path and the registered single-process postprocess modes.

### 3. `simulate_camera_stream.py`

Use this script for live-style multi-camera stream simulation. It is a root wrapper around the modular simulator and applies the split HIP patches before running the CLI.

Best confirmed 10-camera HIP2 stream command:

```bash
mkdir -p outputs/split_hip2_best

python simulate_camera_stream.py \
  --model models/split_pose_adapter/pose_adapter_b2_1080x1920.mxr \
  --variant split_hip2_host_smart \
  --migraphx-batch-size 2 \
  --migraphx-batch-timeout-ms 2 \

## Reading Outputs

Common output files:

```text
outputs/.../*_summary.json
outputs/.../*_detailed.csv
outputs/.../*.mp4
```

`summary.json` contains aggregate FPS, per-camera FPS, average and P95 latency, postprocess timing summaries, worker statistics, batch behavior, and optional system-profile metrics.

`detailed.csv` contains one row per processed frame, including camera ID, frame ID, preprocess time, inference time, decode time, inference-to-postprocess queue time, postprocess time, E2E latency, number of poses, number of keypoints, and split-stage timing columns when available.

---

## Known Limitations

- The best 75.92 FPS stream result is a live-stream output result with latest-frame buffering, not full processing of every input frame from 10 x 24 FPS sources.
- The final HIP2 stream result is not a full COCO AP claim by itself. COCO AP claims are tied to the validation commands and subsets described in the reports.
- Smart-full-res fused-pruned AP parity was validated on a 1000-image dominant-resolution COCO subset, not as a universal statement for every resolution and scene distribution.
- Many MXR artifacts are shape-specific. Changing batch size, input resolution, output resolution, TopK, TopM, or smart-proposal parameters usually requires recompilation.
- The final pose assembly tail is still CPU-side. The major PAF pair scoring/pruning bottleneck was moved to HIP2, but complete end-to-end postprocessing is not fully GPU-native yet.
- The fused HIP1+HIP2 backend remains in the repository as an experiment, but the latest evidence shows it is not the recommended final benchmark path because it worsened GPU overlap and stream latency.
